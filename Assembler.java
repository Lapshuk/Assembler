 File Name: Assembler

 Programmer: Roman Lapshuk 

 Date Last Modified: Wednesday, March 4, 2015 

 Problem Statement: Make an Assembler 
  
   

 Overall Plan : 

1. Draw diagram of needed classes
2. Decided what methods are needed
3. Decided what constants do we have to store in a hash maps
4. Implement the key methods like cleanLine and parsing methods
5. Implement the other methods needed for looking up the constants 
6. Implement the assembler so it only works when there is now varibales and lables
7. Implement the two passes logic in a program. First pass to collect the lables
   Second to write to file and add new variables to the stored table of variables
8. Clean the code, implement error checking


Imported classes needed and Purpose: 
                                    java.util.*;
                                    java.lang.NumberFormatException;
                                    java.io.File;
                                    java.io.FileNotFoundException;
                                    java.io.FileOutputStream;
                                    java.io.PrintWriter;
                                    java.util.Scanner;
                                    javax.swing.JFileChooser;
                                    javax.swing.JOptionPane;
Imported classes are used for a file input/output, exceptions, simple gui.
